							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Profile Banner_1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
						<p>My name is Esteban Cecilio, and I am a 1st-year Computer Engineering student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am currently studying in the specific threads of Computing Hardware & Emerging Architectures and Robotics & Autonomous Systems.</p>
						<p>Reflecting on my past years, a vivid picture emerges of me by my father's side, immersing myself in a number of household projects. From constructing porches to replacing outlets to repairing farm equipment, my childhood was full of hands-on experiences, and notably, delving into the world of electrical components. It was during these moments that my love for electronic components and the ablity to created something tangible and purposeful was born.</p>
						<p>As time moved forward, my journey into the world of electrical components took on a new dimension. I went from my fathers assistant to eager young, error-prone, amateur, to an eventual self sufficient repairman at the house. Through the years my growing competence grew to the point where I could handle these tasks independently. At the same time my passion grew by the day.</p>
						<p>Growing up in a county with a focus on farming imbued my experiences with a unique flavor. Working shoulder to shoulder with my father, we undertook the construction of houses and the meticulous repair of various farming equipment including lawn mowers, weed eaters and ATVs. These experiences helped me grow my desire to new levels.</p>
						<p>Now, as I attend GaTech as a student, my vision extends beyond the horizons of possibility. The plan is to grow my passion for electrical components and systems even more. GaTech is not just a setting for learning; itâ€™s a stage where my learning, understanding and creation within the realm of computer engineering can unfold and flourish.</p>

							<h2>My Future Goals</h2>
						</header>
						<p>A goal I have set for myself is to proudly earn the title of a GaTech graduate. This would not only earn me a degree but also gives me the knowledge to carve out a career that holds the potential to shape the future through impactful work. I wish to contribute meaningfully to the future of innovation and progress.</p>
						<p>To achieve this goal, I would not only need excel in my classes but also extend my abilities through dedicated research in my chosen field. The road to success further requires me to actively seek internships in diverse positions, gaining practical insights that build upon my theoretical understanding. On top of all of that, actively participating in the dynamic environment of the GaTech community promises not only rich experiences but also a network of like-minded individuals.</p>
