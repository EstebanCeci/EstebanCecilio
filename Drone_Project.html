								<h2>Research</h2>
							</header>
							<p>To develop a high-performance drone, a thorough and extensive research phase is crucial. This process unfolded over the course of around a week, marked by a multiple iteration of various components to gauge their compatibility and efficiency amongst each other. The main challenge that emerged prominently was the delicate balance between power and weight ratios.

                            </p>
                            <p>The main issue revolved around the consideration of power-to-weight ratios. If the drone's weight surpassed a certain threshold, it required an increase in voltage output. However, this led to the problem where achieving the required voltage demanded larger components and more consumption of volts. This would raise the problem of voltage requirement inadvertently escalating the overall weight, repeating the original problem of weight and power ratios.
                            </p>    
                            <p>Furthermore, specific components demanded precise voltage levels to operate at their optimal capacity. This would limit the option I could use in the end. This introduced an additional layer of complexity, requiring a roundabout search of components to ensure seamless functionality and efficiency.
                            </p>   
                            <p>The final issue in this drone-building process was the selection of components that operated on the same sending/receiving frequencies. This crucial consideration was required to establish a means of communication to the drone at all times, ensuring that, once assembled, the drone could be seamlessly controlled while airborne.
                            </p>    
                            <p>In essence, the journey to construct an efficient drone would require many iterations of balancing weights, voltages, and component capabilities, requiring multiple iterations and tests to achieve the desired performance.
                            </p>

                            <p>Starting the actual construction of the drone required a planning phase, including the intricacies of wiring paths, optimal mounting locations, and the assembly of the frame. Including this planning phase, was important because I would notice later on would save me a lot of extra time and potentially save me breaking some parts.
                            </p>
                            <p>During this phase,  I immediately noticed that certain cables were too short in length. Because of this, I would need to extend the length of the cable through wire splicing methods. I would achieve this with basic soldering and some heatshrink. This unforeseen problem was caught ahead of time because of the planning phase that I incorporated.
                            </p>   
                            <p>Starting the actual construction of the drone, I had to brush up on my soldering skills. This was mainly due to the tight space that I had to work around. On top of that, there were multiple heat sensitive components surrounding my work area. Such as capacitors and cameras. Secondly, I had to ensure that I was soldering the parts to the correct soldering pad to make sure that they would work correctly once powered on. On top of that I only had a certain amount of mistakes I would make while soldering the parts as the wire would get shorter and shorter every mistake. Lastly, I had to ensure that these soldering was extra secure as these components would eventually be flying hundreds of feet in the air at multiple mph's. These challenges would help me build a level of accuracy, precision, and patience. 
                            </p>    
                            <p>Even through all this planning, I still had an oversight of the length of the capacitors that I used. This required me to purchase another capacitor with the correct leg length. 
                            </p>
                            <p>In the end, constructing the drone consisted of planning, improvisation, soldering finesse, and meticulous attention to detail. It showed the nature of building a drone, where each step demanded a fusion of technical know-how and hands-on expertise to bring the aerial device to life.</p>

								<h2>Post-Editing</h2>
							</header>
                            <p>The final phase of this building process revolved around the post-editing and fine-tuning of each component's specifics. This required multiple adjustments, including motor orientation, precise voltage allocations, video transmission calibration, display overlay adjustments, receiver frequencies synchronization, PiD tuning for stability, and configurations for the controller. This critical step entailed a series of field tests and extensive experimentation with various configurations to achieve the desired precision and power.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately, the entire process was facilitated by a configuration tool named BetaFlight, which streamlined and simplified the testing procedures. Although this stage did not demand the same level of physical and mental utilization as the earlier phases, I firmly believe it was one of, if not the most important stage of the entire building process. Its significance ensured that all the components operated at their optimal performance levels, contributing to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the drone.
